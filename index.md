## Welcome to Center Stage Vintage Guitars

Website reboot. We will get back online sorta soon. 

Store hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 11:00 am to 6:00 pm.

Check out our [Reverb Shop](https://reverb.com/shop/kevins-boutique-173). This is most of our high end stuff. We have a lot more stuff in-store (amps, pedals, more affordable stuff) that we dont bother listing on Reverb because of their brutal commission and shipping and return hassles.  If you are local, stop by and bring cash for the best deal. 

We livestream local musicians every Saturday at 3:00 pm EST on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/CenterStageVintageGuitars) and you can also [follow us on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/centerstagevintageguitars/).

We buy/sell/trade vintage gear and we fix and restore musical instruments and we play both kinds of music here.
